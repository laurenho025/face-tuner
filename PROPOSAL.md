# Final Project Proposal

## Project Idea:
For my final project, I want to create a tuner that visualizes a user's pitch through human facial emotions. I plan on using a single window, on which the user sings a pitch and the main facial model will generate an emotion based on how accurate the user's pitch is. If possible, an extra feature I may add is to color the model based on if the pitch needs to be raised or lowered. 

## Libraries:
This project will be accomplished using [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc). I will be using two main libraries/oF add-ons. [ofxFacialBlendShape](https://github.com/iwanao731/ofxFacialBlendShape) will be used to generate a 3D facial animation and facial emotions. [ofxAudioAnalyzer](https://github.com/leozimmerman/ofxAudioAnalyzer) will be used for analyzing pitch level and confidence.
