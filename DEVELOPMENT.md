# Development Documentation

## Week 1
Most of this week's work was focused on coming up with an idea, finding the applicable libraries, and getting openFrameworks to build and work successfully. I had some difficulty getting the libraries' example projects to build, partly because of  ofxFacialBlendShape's lack of documentation and figuring out aubio's dependencies. Eventually, I figured out openFrameworks and was able to set up the XCode project and add my libraries.
